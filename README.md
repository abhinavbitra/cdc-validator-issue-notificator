# cdc-validator-issue-notificator
This Repo contains a script that automatically sends a notification over the Notify17 API if your validator on the Crypto.com Crossfire-Network is not signing any blocks

Just copy the validator-issue-notificator.sh and add your Notify17 API key in line 4.

To get this API key you have to register an account at https://notify17.net/
Please be aware that the free tier only includes 75 free notifications per month.
(If we don't spam too many transactions this should be enough)

If there is a problem feel free to contact me (Discord: 3r1c#3400)

I am not affiliated, associated, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Notify17
